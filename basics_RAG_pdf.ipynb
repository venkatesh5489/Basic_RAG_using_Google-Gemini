In terms of accuracy, the new\\nmethod outperforms RT DETR [43] pre-trained with a large\\ndataset, and it also outperforms depth-wise convolution-based de-\\nsign YOLO MS [7] in terms of parameters utilization.\\nin the field of deep learning have mainly focused on how\\nto develop more powerful system architectures and learn-\\ning methods, such as CNNs [21–23, 42, 55, 71, 72], Trans-\\nformers [8, 9, 40, 41, 60, 69, 70], Perceivers [26, 26, 32, 52,\\n56, 81, 81], and Mambas [17, 38, 80]. In addition, some\\nresearchers have tried to develop more general objective\\nfunctions, such as loss function [5, 45, 46, 50, 77, 78], la-\\nbel assignment [10, 12, 33, 67, 79] and auxiliary supervi-\\nsion [18, 20, 24, 28, 29, 51, 54, 68, 76].

Visualization results of random initial weight output feature maps for different network architectures: (a) input image, (b)\\nPlainNet, (c) ResNet, (d) CSPNet, and (e) proposed GELAN. From the figure, we can see that in different architectures, the information\\nprovided to the objective function to calculate the loss is lost to varying degrees, and our architecture can retain the most complete\\ninformation and provide the most reliable gradient information for calculating the objective function.\\nIn deep networks, the phenomenon of input data losing\\ninformation during the feedforward process is commonly\\nknown as information bottleneck [59], and its schematic di-\\nagram is as shown in Figure 2. At present, the main meth-\\nods that can alleviate this phenomenon are as follows: (1)\\nThe use of reversible architectures [3, 16, 19]: this method\\nmainly uses repeated input data and maintains the informa-\\ntion of the input data in an explicit way; (2) The use of\\nmasked modeling [1, 6, 9, 27, 71, 73]: it mainly uses recon-\\nstruction loss and adopts an implicit way to maximize the\\nextracted features and retain the input information; and (3)\\nIntroduction of the deep supervision concept [28,51,54,68]:\\nit uses shallow features that have not lost too much impor-\\ntant information to pre-establish a mapping from features\\nto targets to ensure that important information can be trans-\\nferred to deeper layers. However, the above methods have\\ndifferent drawbacks in the training process and inference\\nprocess. For example, a reversible architecture requires ad-\\nditional layers to combine repeatedly fed input data, which\\nwill significantly increase the inference cost. In addition,\\nsince the input data layer to the output layer cannot have a\\ntoo deep path, this limitation will make it difficult to model\\nhigh-order semantic information during the training pro-\\ncess. As for masked modeling, its reconstruction loss some-\\ntimes conflicts with the target loss. In addition, most mask\\nmechanisms also produce incorrect associations with data.\\nFor the deep supervision mechanism, it will produce error\\naccumulation, and if the shallow supervision loses informa-\\ntion during the training process, the subsequent layers will\\nnot be able to retrieve the required information. The above\\nphenomenon will be more significant on difficult tasks and\\nsmall models.\\nTo address the above-mentioned issues, we propose a\\nnew concept, which is programmable gradient information\\n(PGI). The concept is to generate reliable gradients through\\nauxiliary reversible branch, so that the deep features can\\nstill maintain key characteristics for executing target task.\\nThe design of auxiliary reversible branch can avoid the se-\\nmantic loss that may be caused by a traditional deep super-\\nvision process that integrates multi-path features. In other\\nwords, we are programming gradient information propaga-\\ntion at different semantic levels, and thereby achieving the\\nbest training results. The reversible architecture of PGI isbuilt on auxiliary branch, so there is no additional cost.\\nSince PGI can freely select loss function suitable for the\\ntarget task, it also overcomes the problems encountered by\\nmask modeling. The proposed PGI mechanism can be ap-\\nplied to deep neural networks of various sizes and is more\\ngeneral than the deep supervision mechanism, which is only\\nsuitable for very deep neural networks.\\nIn this paper, we also designed generalized ELAN\\n(GELAN) based on ELAN [65], the design of GELAN si-\\nmultaneously takes into account the number of parameters,\\ncomputational complexity, accuracy and inference speed.\\nThis design allows users to arbitrarily choose appropriate\\ncomputational blocks for different inference devices. We\\ncombined the proposed PGI and GELAN, and then de-\\nsigned a new generation of YOLO series object detection\\nsystem, which we call YOLOv9. We used the MS COCO\\ndataset to conduct experiments, and the experimental results\\nverified that our proposed YOLOv9 achieved the top perfor-\\nmance in all comparisons.\\nWe summarize the contributions of this paper as follows:\\n1. We theoretically analyzed the existing deep neural net-\\nwork architecture from the perspective of reversible\\nfunction, and through this process we successfully ex-\\nplained many phenomena that were difficult to explain\\nin the past. We also designed PGI and auxiliary re-\\nversible branch based on this analysis and achieved ex-\\ncellent results.\\n2. The PGI we designed solves the problem that deep su-\\npervision can only be used for extremely deep neu-\\nral network architectures, and therefore allows new\\nlightweight architectures to be truly applied in daily\\nlife.\\n3. The GELAN we designed only uses conventional con-\\nvolution to achieve a higher parameter usage than the\\ndepth-wise convolution design that based on the most\\nadvanced technology, while showing great advantages\\nof being light, fast, and accurate.\\n4. Combining the proposed PGI and GELAN, the object\\ndetection performance of the YOLOv9 on MS COCO\\ndataset greatly surpasses the existing real-time object\\ndetectors in all aspects.\\n2'),\n",

Real-time Object Detectors\\nThe current mainstream real-time object detectors are the\\nYOLO series [2, 7, 13–15, 25, 30, 31, 47–49, 61–63, 74, 75],\\nand most of these models use CSPNet [64] or ELAN [65]\\nand their variants as the main computing units. In terms of\\nfeature integration, improved PAN [37] or FPN [35] is of-\\nten used as a tool, and then improved YOLOv3 head [49] or\\nFCOS head [57, 58] is used as prediction head. Recently\\nsome real-time object detectors, such as RT DETR [43],\\nwhich puts its fundation on DETR [4], have also been pro-\\nposed. However, since it is extremely difficult for DETR\\nseries object detector to be applied to new domains without\\na corresponding domain pre-trained model, the most widely\\nused real-time object detector at present is still YOLO se-\\nries. This paper chooses YOLOv7 [63], which has been\\nproven effective in a variety of computer vision tasks and\\nvarious scenarios, as a base to develop the proposed method.\\nWe use GELAN to improve the architecture and the training\\nprocess with the proposed PGI. The above novel approach\\nmakes the proposed YOLOv9 the top real-time object de-\\ntector of the new generation.\\n2.2. Reversible Architectures\\nThe operation unit of reversible architectures [3, 16, 19]\\nmust maintain the characteristics of reversible conversion,\\nso it can be ensured that the output feature map of each\\nlayer of operation unit can retain complete original informa-\\ntion. Before, RevCol [3] generalizes traditional reversible\\nunit to multiple levels, and in doing so can expand the se-\\nmantic levels expressed by different layer units. Through\\na literature review of various neural network architectures,\\nwe found that there are many high-performing architectures\\nwith varying degree of reversible properties. For exam-\\nple, Res2Net module [11] combines different input parti-\\ntions with the next partition in a hierarchical manner, and\\nconcatenates all converted partitions before passing them\\nbackwards. CBNet [34, 39] re-introduces the original in-\\nput data through composite backbone to obtain complete\\noriginal information, and obtains different levels of multi-\\nlevel reversible information through various composition\\nmethods. These network architectures generally have ex-\\ncellent parameter utilization, but the extra composite layers\\ncause slow inference speeds. DynamicDet [36] combines\\nCBNet [34] and the high-efficiency real-time object detec-\\ntor YOLOv7 [63] to achieve a very good trade-off among\\nspeed, number of parameters, and accuracy. This paper in-\\ntroduces the DynamicDet architecture as the basis for de-\\nsigning reversible branches. In addition, reversible infor-\\nmation is further introduced into the proposed PGI. The\\nproposed new architecture does not require additional con-\\nnections during the inference process, so it can fully retain\\nthe advantages of speed, parameter amount, and accuracy.2.3. Auxiliary Supervision\\nDeep supervision [28,54,68] is the most common auxil-\\niary supervision method, which performs training by insert-\\ning additional prediction layers in the middle layers. Es-\\npecially the application of multi-layer decoders introduced\\nin the transformer-based methods is the most common one.\\nAnother common auxiliary supervision method is to utilize\\nthe relevant meta information to guide the feature maps pro-\\nduced by the intermediate layers and make them have the\\nproperties required by the target tasks [18, 20, 24, 29, 76].\\nExamples of this type include using segmentation loss or\\ndepth loss to enhance the accuracy of object detectors. Re-\\ncently, there are many reports in the literature [53, 67, 82]\\nthat use different label assignment methods to generate dif-\\nferent auxiliary supervision mechanisms to speed up the\\nconvergence speed of the model and improve the robustness\\nat the same time. However, the auxiliary supervision mech-\\nanism is usually only applicable to large models, so when\\nit is applied to lightweight models, it is easy to cause an\\nunder parameterization phenomenon, which makes the per-\\nformance worse. The PGI we proposed designed a way to\\nreprogram multi-level semantic information, and this design\\nallows lightweight models to also benefit from the auxiliary\\nsupervision mechanism.\\n3. Problem Statement\\nUsually, people attribute the difficulty of deep neural net-\\nwork convergence problem due to factors such as gradient\\nvanish or gradient saturation, and these phenomena do ex-\\nist in traditional deep neural networks. However, modern\\ndeep neural networks have already fundamentally solved\\nthe above problem by designing various normalization and\\nactivation functions. Nevertheless, deep neural networks\\nstill have the problem of slow convergence or poor conver-\\ngence results.\\nIn this paper, we explore the nature of the above issue\\nfurther. Through in-depth analysis of information bottle-\\nneck, we deduced that the root cause of this problem is that\\nthe initial gradient originally coming from a very deep net-\\nwork has lost a lot of information needed to achieve the\\ngoal soon after it is transmitted. In order to confirm this\\ninference, we feedforward deep networks of different archi-\\ntectures with initial weights, and then visualize and illus-\\ntrate them in Figure 2. Obviously, PlainNet has lost a lot of\\nimportant information required for object detection in deep\\nlayers. As for the proportion of important information that\\nResNet, CSPNet, and GELAN can retain, it is indeed posi-\\ntively related to the accuracy that can be obtained after train-\\ning. We further design reversible network-based methods to\\nsolve the causes of the above problems. In this section we\\nshall elaborate our analysis of information bottleneck prin-\\nciple and reversible functions.\\n3'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'yolov9_paper.pdf', 'page': 3}, page_content='3.1. Information Bottleneck Principle\\nAccording to information bottleneck principle, we know\\nthat data Xmay cause information loss when going through\\ntransformation, as shown in Eq. 1 below:\\nI(X, X )≥I(X, f θ(X))≥I(X, gϕ(fθ(X))),(1)\\nwhere Iindicates mutual information, fandgare transfor-\\nmation functions, and θandϕare parameters of fandg,\\nrespectively.\\nIn deep neural networks, fθ(·)andgϕ(·)respectively\\nrepresent the operations of two consecutive layers in deep\\nneural network. From Eq. 1, we can predict that as the num-\\nber of network layer becomes deeper, the original data will\\nbe more likely to be lost. However, the parameters of the\\ndeep neural network are based on the output of the network\\nas well as the given target, and then update the network after\\ngenerating new gradients by calculating the loss function.\\nAs one can imagine, the output of a deeper neural network\\nis less able to retain complete information about the pre-\\ndiction target. This will make it possible to use incomplete\\ninformation during network training, resulting in unreliable\\ngradients and poor convergence.\\nOne way to solve the above problem is to directly in-\\ncrease the size of the model. When we use a large number\\nof parameters to construct a model, it is more capable of\\nperforming a more complete transformation of the data. The\\nabove approach allows even if information is lost during the\\ndata feedforward process, there is still a chance to retain\\nenough information to perform the mapping to the target.\\nThe above phenomenon explains why the width is more im-\\nportant than the depth in most modern models. However,\\nthe above conclusion cannot fundamentally solve the prob-\\nlem of unreliable gradients in very deep neural network.\\nBelow, we will introduce how to use reversible functions\\nto solve problems and conduct relative analysis.\\n3.2. Reversible Functions\\nWhen a function rhas an inverse transformation func-\\ntionv, we call this function reversible function, as shown in\\nEq. 2.\\nX=vζ(rψ(X)), (2)\\nwhere ψandζare parameters of randv, respectively. Data\\nXis converted by reversible function without losing infor-\\nmation, as shown in Eq. 3.\\nI(X, X ) =I(X, rψ(X)) =I(X, v ζ(rψ(X))).(3)\\nWhen the network’s transformation function is composed\\nof reversible functions, more reliable gradients can be ob-\\ntained to update the model. Almost all of today’s populardeep learning methods are architectures that conform to the\\nreversible property, such as Eq. 4.\\nXl+1=Xl+fl+1\\nθ(Xl), (4)\\nwhere lindicates the l-th layer of a PreAct ResNet and\\nfis the transformation function of the l-th layer. PreAct\\nResNet [22] repeatedly passes the original data Xto sub-\\nsequent layers in an explicit way. Although such a design\\ncan make a deep neural network with more than a thousand\\nlayers converge very well, it destroys an important reason\\nwhy we need deep neural networks. That is, for difficult\\nproblems, it is difficult for us to directly find simple map-\\nping functions to map data to targets. This also explains\\nwhy PreAct ResNet performs worse than ResNet [21] when\\nthe number of layers is small.\\nIn addition, we tried to use masked modeling that al-\\nlowed the transformer model to achieve significant break-\\nthroughs. We use approximation methods, such as Eq. 5,\\nto try to find the inverse transformation vofr, so that the\\ntransformed features can retain enough information using\\nsparse features. The form of Eq. 5 is as follows:\\nX=vζ(rψ(X)·M), (5)\\nwhere Mis a dynamic binary mask. Other methods that\\nare commonly used to perform the above tasks are diffusion\\nmodel and variational autoencoder, and they both have the\\nfunction of finding the inverse function. However, when\\nwe apply the above approach to a lightweight model, there\\nwill be defects because the lightweight model will be under\\nparameterized to a large amount of raw data. Because of\\nthe above reason, important information I(Y, X)that maps\\ndataXto target Ywill also face the same problem. For this\\nissue, we will explore it using the concept of information\\nbottleneck [59]. The formula for information bottleneck is\\nas follows:\\nI(X, X )≥I(Y, X)≥I(Y, fθ(X))≥...≥I(Y,ˆY).(6)\\nGenerally speaking, I(Y, X)will only occupy a very small\\npart of I(X, X ). However, it is critical to the target mis-\\nsion. Therefore, even if the amount of information lost in\\nthe feedforward stage is not significant, as long as I(Y, X)\\nis covered, the training effect will be greatly affected. The\\nlightweight model itself is in an under parameterized state,\\nso it is easy to lose a lot of important information in the\\nfeedforward stage. Therefore, our goal for the lightweight\\nmodel is how to accurately filter I(Y, X)fromI(X, X ). As\\nfor fully preserving the information of X, that is difficult to\\nachieve. Based on the above analysis, we hope to propose a\\nnew deep neural network training method that can not only\\ngenerate reliable gradients to update the model, but also be\\nsuitable for shallow and lightweight neural networks.\\n4'),\n",

(a) Path Aggregation Network (PAN)) [37], (b) Reversible Columns\\n(RevCol) [3], (c) conventional deep supervision, and (d) our proposed Programmable Gradient Information (PGI). PGI is mainly composed\\nof three components: (1) main branch: architecture used for inference, (2) auxiliary reversible branch: generate reliable gradients to supply\\nmain branch for backward transmission, and (3) multi-level auxiliary information: control main branch learning plannable multi-level of\\nsemantic information.\\n4. Methodology\\n4.1. Programmable Gradient Information\\nIn order to solve the aforementioned problems, we pro-\\npose a new auxiliary supervision framework called Pro-\\ngrammable Gradient Information (PGI), as shown in Fig-\\nure 3 (d). PGI mainly includes three components, namely\\n(1) main branch, (2) auxiliary reversible branch, and (3)\\nmulti-level auxiliary information. From Figure 3 (d) we\\nsee that the inference process of PGI only uses main branch\\nand therefore does not require any additional inference cost.\\nAs for the other two components, they are used to solve or\\nslow down several important issues in deep learning meth-\\nods. Among them, auxiliary reversible branch is designed\\nto deal with the problems caused by the deepening of neural\\nnetworks. Network deepening will cause information bot-\\ntleneck, which will make the loss function unable to gener-\\nate reliable gradients. As for multi-level auxiliary informa-\\ntion, it is designed to handle the error accumulation problem\\ncaused by deep supervision, especially for the architecture\\nand lightweight model of multiple prediction branch. Next,\\nwe will introduce these two components step by step.\\n4.1.1 Auxiliary Reversible Branch\\nIn PGI, we propose auxiliary reversible branch to gener-\\nate reliable gradients and update network parameters. By\\nproviding information that maps from data to targets, the\\nloss function can provide guidance and avoid the possibil-\\nity of finding false correlations from incomplete feedfor-\\nward features that are less relevant to the target. We pro-pose the maintenance of complete information by introduc-\\ning reversible architecture, but adding main branch to re-\\nversible architecture will consume a lot of inference costs.\\nWe analyzed the architecture of Figure 3 (b) and found that\\nwhen additional connections from deep to shallow layers\\nare added, the inference time will increase by 20%. When\\nwe repeatedly add the input data to the high-resolution com-\\nputing layer of the network (yellow box), the inference time\\neven exceeds twice the time.\\nSince our goal is to use reversible architecture to ob-\\ntain reliable gradients, “reversible” is not the only neces-\\nsary condition in the inference stage. In view of this, we\\nregard reversible branch as an expansion of deep supervi-\\nsion branch, and then design auxiliary reversible branch, as\\nshown in Figure 3 (d). As for the main branch deep fea-\\ntures that would have lost important information due to in-\\nformation bottleneck, they will be able to receive reliable\\ngradient information from the auxiliary reversible branch.\\nThese gradient information will drive parameter learning to\\nassist in extracting correct and important information, and\\nthe above actions can enable the main branch to obtain fea-\\ntures that are more effective for the target task. Moreover,\\nthe reversible architecture performs worse on shallow net-\\nworks than on general networks because complex tasks re-\\nquire conversion in deeper networks. Our proposed method\\ndoes not force the main branch to retain complete origi-\\nnal information but updates it by generating useful gradient\\nthrough the auxiliary supervision mechanism. The advan-\\ntage of this design is that the proposed method can also be\\napplied to shallower networks.\\n5'),\n",

We imitate CSPNet and extend ELAN\\ninto GELAN that can support any computational blocks.\\nFinally, since auxiliary reversible branch can be removed\\nduring the inference phase, the inference capabilities of the\\noriginal network can be retained. We can also choose any\\nreversible architectures in PGI to play the role of auxiliary\\nreversible branch.\\n4.1.2 Multi-level Auxiliary Information\\nIn this section we will discuss how multi-level auxiliary in-\\nformation works. The deep supervision architecture includ-\\ning multiple prediction branch is shown in Figure 3 (c). For\\nobject detection, different feature pyramids can be used to\\nperform different tasks, for example together they can de-\\ntect objects of different sizes. Therefore, after connecting\\nto the deep supervision branch, the shallow features will be\\nguided to learn the features required for small object detec-\\ntion, and at this time the system will regard the positions\\nof objects of other sizes as the background. However, the\\nabove deed will cause the deep feature pyramids to lose a lot\\nof information needed to predict the target object. Regard-\\ning this issue, we believe that each feature pyramid needs\\nto receive information about all target objects so that subse-\\nquent main branch can retain complete information to learn\\npredictions for various targets.\\nThe concept of multi-level auxiliary information is to in-\\nsert an integration network between the feature pyramid hi-\\nerarchy layers of auxiliary supervision and the main branch,\\nand then uses it to combine returned gradients from differ-\\nent prediction heads, as shown in Figure 3 (d). Multi-level\\nauxiliary information is then to aggregate the gradient infor-\\nmation containing all target objects, and pass it to the main\\nbranch and then update parameters. At this time, the charac-\\nteristics of the main branch’s feature pyramid hierarchy will\\nnot be dominated by some specific object’s information. As\\na result, our method can alleviate the broken information\\nproblem in deep supervision. In addition, any integrated\\nnetwork can be used in multi-level auxiliary information.\\nTherefore, we can plan the required semantic levels to guide\\nthe learning of network architectures of different sizes.4.2. Generalized ELAN\\nIn this Section we describe the proposed new network\\narchitecture – GELAN. By combining two neural network\\narchitectures, CSPNet [64] and ELAN [65], which are de-\\nsigned with gradient path planning, we designed gener-\\nalized efficient layer aggregation network (GELAN) that\\ntakes into account lighweight, inference speed, and accu-\\nracy. Its overall architecture is shown in Figure 4. We gen-\\neralized the capability of ELAN [65], which originally only\\nused stacking of convolutional layers, to a new architecture\\nthat can use any computational blocks.\\n5. Experiments\\n5.1.

The above comparison\\nresults show that our proposed YOLOv9 has significantlyimproved in all aspects compared with existing methods.\\nOn the other hand, we also include ImageNet pretrained\\nmodel in the comparison, and the results are shown in Fig-\\nure 5. We compare them based on the parameters and the\\namount of computation respectively. In terms of the num-\\nber of parameters, the best performing large model is RT\\nDETR [43]. From Figure 5, we can see that YOLOv9 using\\nconventional convolution is even better than YOLO MS us-\\ning depth-wise convolution in parameter utilization. As for\\nthe parameter utilization of large models, it also greatly sur-\\npasses RT DETR using ImageNet pretrained model. Even\\nbetter is that in the deep model, YOLOv9 shows the huge\\nadvantages of using PGI.

The methods participating in the comparison all use ImageNet as\\npre-trained weights, including RT DETR [43], RTMDet [44], and PP-YOLOE [74], etc. The YOLOv9 that uses train-from-scratch method\\nclearly surpasses the performance of other methods.\\nAs for the amount of computation, the best existing mod-\\nels from the smallest to the largest are YOLO MS [7], PP\\nYOLOE [74], and RT DETR [43].

Ablation Studies\\n5.4.1 Generalized ELAN\\nFor GELAN, we first do ablation studies for computational\\nblocks. We used Res blocks [21], Dark blocks [49], and\\nCSP blocks [64] to conduct experiments, respectively. Ta-\\nble 2 shows that after replacing convolutional layers in\\nELAN with different computational blocks, the system can\\nmaintain good performance. Users are indeed free to re-\\nplace computational blocks and use them on their respective\\ninference devices. Among different computational block re-\\nplacements, CSP blocks perform particularly well. They\\nnot only reduce the amount of parameters and computation,\\nbut also improve AP by 0.7%. Therefore, we choose CSP-\\nELAN as the component unit of GELAN in YOLOv9.\\nTable 2. Ablation study on various computational blocks.\\nModel CB type #Param.

But when the depth is greater than or\\nequal to 2, no matter it is improving the ELAN depth or the\\nCSP depth, the number of parameters, the amount of com-\\nputation, and the accuracy will always show a linear rela-\\ntionship. This means GELAN is not sensitive to the depth.\\nIn other words, users can arbitrarily combine the compo-\\nnents in GELAN to design the network architecture, and\\nhave a model with stable performance without special de-\\nsign.

As analyzed at\\nthe beginning, introduction of deep supervision will cause\\na loss of accuracy for shallow models. As for general mod-\\nels, introducing deep supervision will cause unstable perfor-\\nmance, and the design concept of deep supervision can only\\nbring gains in extremely deep models. The proposed PGI\\ncan effectively handle problems such as information bottle-\\nneck and information broken, and can comprehensively im-\\nprove the accuracy of models of different sizes. The concept\\nof PGI brings two valuable contributions.

In Figure 6\\nwe show the visualization results of feature maps obtained\\nby using random initial weights as feedforward under dif-\\nferent architectures. We can see that as the number of lay-\\ners increases, the original information of all architectures\\ngradually decreases. For example, at the 50thlayer of the\\nPlainNet, it is difficult to see the location of objects, and all\\ndistinguishable features will be lost at the 100thlayer. As\\nfor ResNet, although the position of object can still be seen\\nat the 50thlayer, the boundary information has been lost.\\nWhen the depth reached to the 100thlayer, the whole image\\nbecomes blurry. Both CSPNet and the proposed GELAN\\nperform very well, and they both can maintain features that\\nsupport clear identification of objects until the 200thlayer.\\nAmong the comparisons, GELAN has more stable results\\nand clearer boundary information.\\n9'),\n",

Feature maps (visualization results) output by random initial weights of PlainNet, ResNet, CSPNet, and GELAN at different\\ndepths. After 100 layers, ResNet begins to produce feedforward output that is enough to obfuscate object information.

PAN feature maps (visualization results) of GELAN\\nand YOLOv9 (GELAN + PGI) after one epoch of bias warm-up.\\nGELAN originally had some divergence, but after adding PGI’s\\nreversible branch, it is more capable of focusing on the target ob-\\nject.\\nFigure 7 is used to show whether PGI can provide more\\nreliable gradients during the training process, so that the\\nparameters used for updating can effectively capture the\\nrelationship between the input data and the target. Fig-\\nure 7 shows the visualization results of the feature map of\\nGELAN and YOLOv9 (GELAN + PGI) in PAN bias warm-\\nup.

Conclusions\\nIn this paper, we propose to use PGI to solve the infor-\\nmation bottleneck problem and the problem that the deep\\nsupervision mechanism is not suitable for lightweight neu-\\nral networks. We designed GELAN, a highly efficient\\nand lightweight neural network. In terms of object detec-\\ntion, GELAN has strong and stable performance at different\\ncomputational blocks and depth settings. It can indeed be\\nwidely expanded into a model suitable for various inference\\ndevices. For the above two issues, the introduction of PGI\\nallows both lightweight models and deep models to achieve\\nsignificant improvements in accuracy. The YOLOv9, de-\\nsigned by combining PGI and GELAN, has shown strong\\ncompetitiveness. Its excellent design allows the deep model\\nto reduce the number of parameters by 49% and the amount\\nof calculations by 43% compared with YOLOv8, but it still\\nhas a 0.6% AP improvement on MS COCO dataset.\\n7.

Here\\nare only list of additional data of DynamicDet [36] for com-\\nparisons; (2) Pretrained by ImageNet: this includes two\\nmethods of using ImageNet for supervised pretrain and self-\\nsupervised pretrain; (3) knowledge distillation: a method\\nto perform additional self-distillation after training is com-pleted; and (4) a more complex training process: a combi-\\nnation of steps including pretrained by ImageNet, knowl-\\nedge distillation, DAMO-YOLO and even additional pre-\\ntrained large object detection dataset. We show the results\\nin Table 3. From this table, we can see that our proposed\\nYOLOv9 performed better than all other methods. Com-\\npared with PPYOLOE+-X trained using ImageNet and Ob-\\njects365, our method still reduces the number of parame-\\nters by 55% and the amount of computation by 11%, and\\nimproving 0.4% AP.\\n2'),\n",

The proposed PGI mechanism can be ap-\\nplied to deep neural networks of various sizes and is more\\ngeneral than the deep supervision mechanism, which is only\\nsuitable for very deep neural networks.\\nIn this paper, we also designed generalized ELAN\\n(GELAN) based on ELAN [65], the design of GELAN si-\\nmultaneously takes into account the number of parameters,\\ncomputational complexity, accuracy and inference speed.\\nThis design allows users to arbitrarily choose appropriate\\ncomputational blocks for different inference devices. We\\ncombined the proposed PGI and GELAN, and then de-\\nsigned a new generation of YOLO series object detection\\nsystem, which we call YOLOv9. We used the MS COCO\\ndataset to conduct experiments, and the experimental results\\nverified that our proposed YOLOv9 achieved the top perfor-\\nmance in all comparisons.\\nWe summarize the contributions of this paper as follows:')"
